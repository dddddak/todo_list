# todo_list

<<Description>>
  To show up the list of the user needs to do daily and check the tasks are done by using SQLite and Python. The user can add, edit, and delete tasks with a name, description, due date, and status(complete/incomplete). Additionally, they can view all tasks or filter them by due date or status.


<<How to work>>
  Once you run this code, it will show you five options with welcome sign, which are add list, view lists, mark list as complete, delete list, and exit. First, 'Add List' allows you to add your new list with name, description, due date, and status. Second, 'View Lists' shows you all lists and leads you sort lists by due date or status, or due date AND status. Third, 'Mark List as Complete' can mark a list incomplete to complete since you finish the task. Fourth, 'Delete List' allows you to delete a list or to delete all lists you've done or you mistype. Lastly, 'Exit' is able to stop this code and close sql and database connection.
